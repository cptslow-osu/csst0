# CptSlow's Gatari Speed Tournament

## Tournament Summary
* Held on Gatari (duh)
* osu! Standard
* 1v1
* Double Elimination
* 2 Divisions
* 50 USD Prizepool
* Scorev2
* HD allowed on all pools with .95 multiplier (which gives it a slight buff over NoMod, ~.94 would make them equal)
* Open Qualifiers (Split into 5.5* and 6.5* Quali Division)[On Bancho this would be BWS 5digit and 4digit]
* Players will be manually split into Divisions by Staff (on Bancho this would be handled by BWS). We may ask you to play a different pool previously to gauge your skill. Trying to cheat us (by sandbagging when we ask you to play) will get you disqualified.
* Badge? Still waiting for requirements from Firedigger
* Check the GDoc for pool formatting and more.
